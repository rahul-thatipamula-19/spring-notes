**spring** **framework**:

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful, open-source framework for building Java applications, particularly enterprise-level applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java applications, including support for **dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), transaction management, and more**.
The **Spring Framework** was created by **Rod Johnson**.

| **Definition** | A programming language is a formal set of instructions used to communicate with a computer and develop software. | A framework is a pre-built collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that help in faster and structured development. |

|             |                                                      |                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Provides syntax, rules, and logic to write programs. | Provides reusable code, components, and structures for faster development. |

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Examples**|Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Dart|Spring (Java), Django (Python), React (JavaScript), Flutter (Dart)|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Flexibility**|Gives full control over the program structure and logic.|Provides a structured way to develop applications but may impose limitations.|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Usage**|Used to create software, from small scripts to large applications.|Used to simplify development by offering built-in functionalities and design patterns.|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Dependency**|Self-sufficient; does not rely on external code structures.|Built using programming languages; cannot function without them.|
