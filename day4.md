IOC(Inversion of control) :

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where **the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the developer to a framework or container**.

->IOC is known as Implementation of DI(dependency Injection).
-> IOC container will create the objects at the first runtime instance of the java application.

->Internally the IOC container follows Dependency injection.


***Spring IOC Container :*** 

  The **Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container** is the **core of the Spring Framework**. It **manages the lifecycle** and **dependencies of objects (beans)** in a Spring application.

ðŸ”¹ **What does it do?**  
âœ” **Creates objects (beans)**  
âœ” **Manages dependencies** (Dependency Injection - DI)  
âœ” **Controls the lifecycle** of beans (initialization, destruction)  
âœ” **Promotes loose coupling** by handling object dependencies externally
